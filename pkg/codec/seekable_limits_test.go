// The seeking read path's resource budgets — F4.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. SEC-001 (decompression bombs) and SEC-002
// (allocate-before-verify) are enforced by the SEQUENTIAL reader and were not
// reachable from BlockIndex at all: Limits could not be passed to
// OpenBlockIndex, ReadBlock sized its buffer from a uint32 read straight off
// disk before reading a byte, and its decoder was constructed with no
// WithDecoderMaxMemory (klauspost's own default cap is 64 GiB). Measured by the
// bug hunt, 2026-09-05:
//
//	sequential Reader, WithMaxDecodedBytes(16 MiB): clean error, HeapAlloc 9 MiB
//	BlockIndex.ReadBlock(1): len=2147483648 err=nil in 10.5s, HeapAlloc 3699 MiB
//	compressedSize=0xFFFFFFFF: ReadBlock(1) -> "reading block 1 at 52: EOF"
//	                           AFTER HeapAlloc 4097 MiB
//
// The second line is the shape of the defect precisely: the error was correct
// and it arrived AFTER the allocation. A reader that refuses a hostile file
// only once it has already allocated what the file asked for has not refused
// it.
//
// The budgets are the same ones the sequential reader uses, reached the same
// way — a ReaderOption — so a caller does not have to know which read path a
// library function took in order to bound it.

// seekTableEntryOffsets returns the byte offsets, within a per-block capture,
// of entry n's Compressed_Size and Decompressed_Size fields.
//
// The layout is fixed by the zstd seekable format and is documented at the top
// of seekable.go: the table is the last thing in the file, ending with
// Number_Of_Frames (4) + Seek_Table_Descriptor (1) + Seekable_Magic_Number (4),
// preceded by the entries. Computing it here rather than exporting a mutator
// keeps the crafting in the test, where a hostile file belongs.
func seekTableEntryOffsets(t *testing.T, data []byte, n, blocks int) (compressed, decompressed int) {

// MUTATION WITNESS, and it is recorded because the first evidence offered for
// these tests was a COMPILE ERROR — OpenBlockIndex did not take options yet —
// and a build failure is not a failing test. It proves the API was absent; it
// does not demonstrate the defect was reachable. Removing ReadBlock's four
// checks (the file-size bound, the budget check, the frame-header cross-check
// with its decoder cap, and the decoded-size equality) leaves the API intact,
// so the tests RUN, and they fail on behaviour:
//

//	    seekable_limits_test.go:123: ReadBlock allocated 1073746976 bytes
//	    refusing a block that claims 1073741824 from a 1216-byte file
//	    (SEC-002, allocate-before-verify).
//	--- FAIL: TestReadBlockRefusesASizeTheFileCannotHold (0.00s)
//	=== RUN   TestReadBlockBoundsDecoderMemory
//	    seekable_limits_test.go:192: ReadBlock returned 268435456 bytes and NO
//	    error for a block the seek table says yields 182
//	    seekable_limits_test.go:201: bomb block: err=<nil>, 268780048 bytes
//	    allocated
//	--- FAIL: TestReadBlockBoundsDecoderMemory (0.18s)

//	    returned <nil>; want ErrMaxDecodedBytes
//	--- FAIL: TestOpenBlockIndexTakesReaderOptions (0.00s)
//
// That is the DoS firing: a gibibyte allocated to refuse a 1.2 KB file, and a
// quarter-gibibyte decoded with no error at all.
//
// THE RUN ABOVE IS LEFT VERBATIM, INCLUDING A TEST NAME THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.
// TestReadBlockBoundsDecoderMemory was renamed on 2026-09-07 to
// TestReadBlockRefusesAFrameWhoseSizeContradictsTheSeekTable, because its bomb
// carries a Frame_Content_Size and is therefore answered by the frame-header
// cross-check rather than by the decoder cap. Editing the quoted output to match
// would destroy the record of what actually ran, so it stands as written and this
// note carries the correction forward. See that test's own comment.
//
// The same qualification applies to this block as a whole: it removed the four
// checks TOGETHER. Removed ONE AT A TIME, three of the four leave the suite green
// — measured 2026-09-07: the file-size bound and the budget check each go red,
// while the FCS cross-check, the decoder cap and the decoded-size equality each
// pass alone. "Removing the checks fails on behaviour" is true of the set and not
// of the members, and reading it as the latter is what left the residual F4 hole
// open until 9c019a7.
