// maxWriterWindow is the largest zstd window any capture this library wrote can
// carry, and it is FOUND rather than chosen. klauspost sets the encoder window
// from the level and nothing else: SpeedFastest gives 4 MiB, and SpeedDefault,
// SpeedBetterCompression and SpeedBestCompression each give 8 MiB
// (compress@v1.19.2 zstd/encoder_options.go:246-259; the package default is
// also 8 MiB at :42). Every encoder in this package is constructed with
// WithEncoderLevel and no window option — tape.go:133,137 @ 5bcb5a3 and
// tape_blocks.go:198,203 @ 5bcb5a3 — so 8 MiB is the ceiling our own writer can
// reach.
//
// THE TWO CITATIONS ABOVE ARE THE WHOLE DERIVATION, and they are pinned because
// the bound is only found for as long as they hold. The predicate that falsifies
// it is one command:
//
//	git grep -n 'WithWindowSize' <sha> -- pkg cmd
//
// EXPECTED OUTPUT IS NOT EMPTY, and saying so is the point: at 5bcb5a3 it was,
// but this comment and seekable_window_test.go now match it, so a reader running
// it today gets three hits and must read them rather than count them.
//
//	seekable.go:30                     this line
//	seekable_window_test.go:56,197     the hostile windows the tests craft
//
// Those three are the pass. A hit OUTSIDE a _test.go file is the failure: some
// writer chose its own window, and this constant must be re-derived from that
// call rather than left as a number somebody once measured.
//
// The same predicate answers the question this package cannot answer about
// itself — whether a PRODUCER can emit a file this reader would refuse. Surveyed
// 2026-09-07 across tape, nevr-stream and nevr-agent: no production code in any
// of the three sets a window; nevr-stream (internal/api/storage_manager.go:116)
// and nevr-agent (internal/agent/writer_tape.go:96) both write through the
// zero-option codec.NewWriter and inherit this ceiling, and the one direct
// encoder outside tape (nevr-agent internal/agent/legacy_writer.go:26) uses
// SpeedFastest, which is 4 MiB — half of it. That survey covers *.go in those
// three trees and nothing else; a producer written elsewhere, or in another
// language, is not covered by it.
//
// AND IT HAS AN EXPIRY, NOT ONLY A PERIMETER. The sentence above scopes WHERE I
// looked. It does not scope WHEN, and that is the half that rots: a survey
// enumerates the producers that existed on its date, so a producer created after
// it is outside the evidence no matter how thoroughly the trees were searched.
// This is not hypothetical as of 2026-09-07 — nevr-agent, one of the two
// surveyed producers, is being RETIRED in favour of a direct engine-memory
// reader that did not exist when the survey ran and has never been read. Nothing
// above is wrong; it is simply evidence about a producer set that is changing.
//
// So: the grep is repo-local and can never see a producer in another repository,
// and the survey is a snapshot and can never see a producer added after it. The
// failure mode both miss is the same one and it is the benign-looking direction —
// a LEGITIMATE capture refused with ErrWindowTooLarge, not a bomb let through.
// Whoever adds a producer re-runs the predicate against it; whoever hits an
// unexpected ErrWindowTooLarge on a file they trust should suspect this constant
// before suspecting the file.
//
// It is deliberately NOT read from the file. hdr.WindowSize is the hostile
// file's own number, and a cap computed from it is the attacker choosing their
// own ceiling: klauspost sizes the history buffer from the frame's window
// (zstd/framedec.go:255-266), so a frame declaring 256 MiB costs about that
// much before any other check can object. Measured on this path: a 54,303-byte
// crafted file drove 1433.4 MiB of allocation with the caller's budget set to
// 1 MiB, and the cost tracked the file's number linearly (39.5 / 191.6 / 788.7
// / 1433.4 MiB for declared payloads of 8 / 32 / 128 / 256 MiB).
//
// Nothing in docs/format-design.md specifies a window for the container, so
// this is a policy of THIS reader, not a conformance rule of the format: a
// third-party writer using a larger window would produce a file zstd considers
// valid and this reader refuses. The error says so rather than calling it
// corruption.
const maxWriterWindow = 8 << 20

// describeOversizeWindow says which of two shapes an over-ceiling window has, so
// that a refusal diagnoses itself instead of arriving as a support ticket.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. maxWriterWindow is derived from a producer survey, and a survey
// has both a perimeter and an expiry (see above). The failure mode it cannot see
// is the benign-looking one: a LEGITIMATE capture, from a producer nobody
// surveyed, refused as though it were an attack. The reader cannot avoid that —
// it must refuse what it cannot bound — but it can say which of the two it thinks
// it is looking at, and that turns "why won't this file open" into a pointer at
// this constant.
//
// THE DISCRIMINATOR IS DERIVED, NOT PICKED. A zstd window is a back-reference
// distance, so it can never usefully exceed the data it references, and klauspost
// shrinks the window descriptor to fit short content. A legitimate block
// therefore satisfies window <= max(declared, MinWindowSize); the floor is zstd's
// own 1 KiB minimum window (zstd.MinWindowSize, compress@v1.19.2
// zstd/framedec.go:38-39), which even a tiny block still carries. Measured both
// ways: a real nevr-stream capture rewritten per-block carries a 1 KiB window
// against ~113 KiB blocks, while the hostile file in
// TestReadBlockRefusesAWindowThisLibraryCannotHaveWritten carries a 256 MiB
// window against 182 declared bytes — a frame asking to buy memory it has no data
// to reference.
//
// NEITHER BRANCH SAYS A FILE IS LEGITIMATE, and the wording keeps that honest.
// Both operands are numbers the file chose, so this can be lied to; it is a
// DIAGNOSTIC on a refusal that has already happened, never an input to it. The
// benign branch means "this does not have the attack's shape — go look at
// maxWriterWindow's producer survey", not "this file is fine".
//
// If nevr-stream begins serving byte ranges, the version to reach for is the
// stronger one this deliberately is not: a distinct sentinel or counter, so the
// ceiling biting real data is observable in aggregate rather than one error
// message at a time. That earns its own gate; this does not, because it changes
// no behaviour.

// The zstd seekable format — the index that makes a per-block .tape servable.
//
// A .tape written as one continuous zstd stream records keyframe byte offsets
// that nothing can seek to: the offsets are positions in the DECOMPRESSED
// stream, and reaching any of them means decompressing from the start. The
// container doc comment on Writer admits this in as many words. Splitting the
// container into independent zstd frames fixes the seeking, but only if
// something records where each frame begins in the COMPRESSED file.
//
// That index is not invented here. The zstd seekable format is the existing
// prior art for exactly this problem, and it is used verbatim:
//
//	facebook/zstd, contrib/seekable_format/zstd_seekable_compression_format.md
//
// Its shape, from that specification:
//
//	Seek_Table_Frame
//	  Skippable_Magic_Number   4 B LE  0x184D2A5E
//	  Frame_Size               4 B LE  byte length of everything after this field
//	  Seek_Table_Entries       N x (8 B, or 12 B with checksums)
//	  Seek_Table_Footer        9 B
//
//	Seek_Table_Entry
//	  Compressed_Size          4 B LE
//	  Decompressed_Size        4 B LE
//	  Checksum                 4 B LE  (present only if the descriptor says so)
//
//	Seek_Table_Footer
//	  Number_Of_Frames         4 B LE
//	  Seek_Table_Descriptor    1 B     bit 7 = checksums present; bits 6-2 reserved, must be 0
//	  Seekable_Magic_Number    4 B LE  0x8F92EAB1
//
// Two properties are why this shape and not a bespoke trailer, and both are
// verified against the pinned decoder in zstd_container_behavior_test.go rather
// than taken on faith:
//
//   - The table rides in a zstd SKIPPABLE frame, so a decoder that knows
//     nothing about seeking skips it instead of failing on it. The index costs
//     existing readers nothing.
//   - The footer is fixed-size and sits at EOF, so the table is locatable
//     backwards from the end of the file without decompressing anything.
//
// The table records block sizes; it does not record which capture frame starts
// which block. That mapping is already the job of CaptureFooter.keyframe_index,
// and the two are read together: the keyframe index answers "which block holds
// frame N", the seek table answers "where does that block begin and how big is
// it".

//
//  1. The block must FIT IN THE FILE. The file's size is the one fact about a
//     capture that does not come out of the capture, so it bounds the buffer
//     before a byte is allocated.
//  2. The declared decompressed size must fit the caller's budget, checked
//     before decoding rather than after.
//  3. The FRAME HEADER is parsed before the frame is decoded. zstd states a
//     frame's content size in its own header, so a block whose header
//     disagrees with the seek table is refused having allocated nothing — this
//     is what catches the 2 GiB-of-zeros case, and it costs a header parse.
//     The decoder is then capped, and the decoded length must EQUAL the
//     declared size. Resolving a disagreement in the file's favour is how a
//     426 KB file becomes a 2 GB allocation.
//
// THE CAP IS NOT THE DECLARED SIZE, and the first attempt at this made it so:
// WithDecoderMaxMemory(182) rejected a legitimate 182-byte block with "window
// size exceeded", because klauspost checks the frame's WINDOW against that
// budget and the encoder's window is megabytes regardless of how little the
// block holds. The cap is therefore max(declared, the frame's own declared
// window) — still a bound the file cannot inflate past what it already
// committed to in its header, and check 3's equality is what makes a lie about

	// the window ceiling down to it (zstd/framedec.go:51-53). That is why the
	// earlier attempt here, WithDecoderMaxMemory(182), rejected a legitimate
	// 182-byte block with "window size exceeded": the one call had also capped
	// the window at 182 bytes. The previous fix for that was to widen the cap
	// with hdr.WindowSize, which fixed the false positive by handing the
	// attacker the ceiling.
	//
	// So set the two separately. WithDecoderMaxWindow
	// (zstd/decoder_options.go:143-160) is the window knob on its own, and it
	// gets maxWriterWindow — a number from our writer, which the file cannot
	// influence. It is not redundant with check 3c above: 3c parses ONE frame
	// header, and DecodeAll decodes every frame concatenated in the block, so
	// this is what bounds a window hidden behind an innocent first frame.
	//
	// WithDecoderMaxMemory then gets the DECODED ceiling. It must not sit below
	// maxWriterWindow or the framedec clamp reintroduces the false positive, and
	// it must admit declared, which check 2 has already bounded against the
	// caller's own MaxDecodedBytes. max(declared, maxWriterWindow) is both, and
	// both terms are ours: the seek table's declared size, already budget-checked,

		//     DIFFERENT id      — helped. The ids visibly disagree.
		//   WRONG dictionary,
		//     SAME id (F3)      — NOT helped, and cannot be. Two dictionaries
		//                         trained at the same id are indistinguishable
		//                         here by construction; the number printed is

		// disagrees". There is no stored dictionary hash to compare against —

		// finding in its own comments. If F3's same-id collision is ever to be
