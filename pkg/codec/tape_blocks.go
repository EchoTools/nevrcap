// Per-block container layout — THE DEFAULT since v4.1.0.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Writer's own doc comment concedes the defect: "Because the
// stream is Zstd-compressed, byte-offset seeking requires decompressing from
// the start." One zstd.NewWriter wraps the whole file, so every
// KeyframeEntry.ByteOffset is a position in the DECOMPRESSED stream and
// nothing can seek to it. The keyframe index shipped; the property it exists
// for did not. This file supplies the property.
//
// THE LAYOUT. Compression moves inside the container: instead of one zstd
// stream over the whole file, the file becomes a sequence of INDEPENDENT zstd
// frames, and a block boundary falls on a keyframe. One decision does two jobs
// — the keyframe interval is also the block size — rather than two numbers
// drifting apart.
//
//	[zstd frame]  header block                — the CaptureHeader alone
//	[zstd frame]  block 0                     — opens at keyframe, N frames
//	[zstd frame]  block 1                     — opens at the next keyframe
//	...
//	[zstd frame]  footer block                — the CaptureFooter alone
//	[skippable]   seek table (seekable.go)    — block sizes, locatable from EOF
//
// The header gets its own block so that rewriting it — the metadata edit that
// a strip or a re-derivation performs — recompresses one small block instead of
// the first N frames with it. The footer gets its own block for the same
// reason and because it is written last.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS EXISTING READERS: nothing. zstd decoders are specified to
// decode concatenated frames as one continuous stream and to skip skippable
// frames, so the shipped sequential Reader reads a per-block tape unchanged.
// That is not inherited from the spec — it is verified against the pinned
// klauspost/compress in zstd_container_behavior_test.go, and those tests stay
// as gates.
//
// WHAT IT CHANGES ON DISK: the byte layout, and the meaning of
// KeyframeEntry.ByteOffset, which in this mode is the offset of the block in
// the COMPRESSED file rather than in the decompressed stream.
//
// WHY IT IS THE DEFAULT, AND WHEN THAT CHANGED. It shipped opt-in, on the
// reasoning that a format change must be asked for by name. Andrew overruled
// that on 2026-09-05 15:54, and the ruling is the authority for this file:
//
//	"fix it. all features default.... you use args to opt out"
//	"your acting like this proto is already released.. it's not.. THIS is
//	 the release."
//
// The old reasoning protected a release that had not happened. What it cost
// was real: the seekability this layout exists for was off for every caller
// who did not know the option's name, which is every caller. So NewWriter,
// NewWriterWithKeyframeInterval and NewWriterWithOptions with no options all
// produce THIS layout, and WithWholeStreamCompression is how a caller opts
// back out.

// WriterOption configures a Writer. Options that change the on-disk layout say
// so in their own doc comment. The zero-option writer takes every feature that
// can be on by default: per-block compression at DefaultKeyframeInterval,
// compressed at zstd.SpeedFastest. Turning a feature OFF is what takes an
// argument.
type WriterOption func(*writerConfig)

// writerConfig is the folded result of the options passed to
// NewWriterWithOptions.
type writerConfig struct {
	dict             []byte
	level            zstd.EncoderLevel
	keyframeInterval uint32
	perBlock         bool
}

// WithKeyframeInterval sets how often a keyframe is recorded, in frames. Zero
// is clamped to DefaultKeyframeInterval (GH #23: it reached
// `frameIndex % keyframeInterval` and panicked with a divide by zero).
//
// Under the default per-block layout this interval is also the block size, so
// it sets seek granularity as well as index density. Under
// WithWholeStreamCompression it sets index density only.
func WithKeyframeInterval(n uint32) WriterOption {
	return func(c *writerConfig) { c.keyframeInterval = n }

// zstd.SpeedFastest, which is what the shipped writer has always used.
func WithCompressionLevel(level zstd.EncoderLevel) WriterOption {

}

// WithPerBlockCompression writes the capture as independent per-block zstd
// frames plus a seek table, instead of one continuous zstd stream. What it
// buys: a keyframe offset becomes a servable byte range, and reaching frame N
// costs one block instead of the whole file.
//
// THIS IS THE DEFAULT as of v4.1.0 — the option is now a no-op that states an
// intent. It is kept, rather than deleted, because call sites and tests name it
// and because writing it makes a caller's requirement explicit at the call site
// instead of dependent on this package's default. It is idempotent and it wins
// over an earlier WithWholeStreamCompression, so options fold last-wins in
// either order.
func WithPerBlockCompression() WriterOption {
	return func(c *writerConfig) { c.perBlock = true }
}

// WithWholeStreamCompression writes the capture as ONE continuous zstd stream
// with no seek table — the layout tape wrote before v4.1.0.
//
// THIS IS THE OPT-OUT, and it is the only way to get that layout now. What it
// costs, and the reason it is not the default: KeyframeEntry.ByteOffset goes
// back to being an offset in the DECOMPRESSED stream, which nothing can seek
// to, so reaching frame N means decompressing every byte before it and serving
// a range of the file is impossible. Integrity also gets later rather than
// absent: a per-block capture's zstd content checksum fires at every block
// boundary, so a flipped bit or a wrong dictionary is caught within one
// keyframe interval, where a whole-stream capture reaches its single checksum
// only at end of file.
//
// It exists for exactly two callers: one that must produce bytes an
// already-deployed pre-v4.1.0 reader consumes byte-identically, and one
// streaming to a sink where the trailing seek table cannot be written. Anything
// else should take the default.

}

// WithDictionary compresses with a trained zstd dictionary. Telemetry is close
// to a dictionary's ideal case — many small payloads with identical field
// structure and no shared window — which is what makes per-block compression
// cheap rather than costly.
//
// A dictionary is a PERMANENT OBLIGATION: a capture written with dictionary D
// needs D forever to be read. zstd records the dictionary's id in every frame
// header it writes, so a reader without it fails loudly rather than returning
// wrong bytes (verified in zstd_container_behavior_test.go), but the bytes
// themselves must be kept somewhere the reader can find. Passing nil is the
// same as not passing the option.

	// exception is WithDictionary, and it is an exception of KIND rather than
	// of policy: a dictionary is trained bytes that do not exist at
	// construction time and cannot be conjured, and it is a permanent
	// obligation on every future reader. There is no dictionary to default TO.
