// verdict_test.go — the receipt's own honesty.
//
// A Verdict authorizes deleting an irreplaceable recording. Two properties are
// therefore not negotiable, and both are tested here rather than assumed:
//
//   - it never describes work it did not do, and
//   - it never passes by default. Passing is something a verification has to
//     EARN by running to the end; the zero value of a struct is not a proof.

// TestZeroVerdictFailsClosed pins that the zero value of an exported type whose
// meaning is "this file is safe to delete" does not mean that. A Verdict is a
// receipt for work performed; an unpopulated one is a receipt for nothing.
