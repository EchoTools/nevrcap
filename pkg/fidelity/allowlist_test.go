// TestAllowlistMatchesExactPathsOnly pins the one thing the allowlist must get
// right, per Andrew's 2026-07-25 ruling ("errors on ... any fields/differences
// in the round trip source and target"): an entry excuses THE PATH IT NAMES and
// nothing beneath it.
//
// It previously absorbed whole subtrees, so "SessionResponse.last_throw has no
// v2 home" also excused a reconstruction that returned arm_speed=999 for a
// recorded 12.5. A wrong value is not the documented hole; it is a different
// defect wearing the hole's excuse. 52 of 138 SessionResponse paths were
// unfailable that way.
//
// The kind suffixes (#presence, #count) are the SAME path in a different
// failure mode, not a child of it, so an entry covers them.
