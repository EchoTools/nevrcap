// seedEventsForCut builds the events a trimmed capture needs on its first
// frame so that replaying it from the cut reproduces the state the source had
// there (GH #44).
//
// v2 is a delta format: identity, loadout, grab, stats, the scoreboard and the
// last goal are carried by events and materialized by replaying them from the
// beginning. Dropping the frames before --start therefore discards the frame-0
// seeding and every change that happened before the cut, and the trimmed file
// reconstructs into state that is not missing but *fabricated as absent* —
// players with no stats block, empty hands, no last_score, zero round scores.
// A round-trip of the trimmed file does not notice, because both sides agree.
//
// The state comes from conversion.Session, the same replay the reconstructor
// uses, rather than from a second hand-written accumulator. The recurring
// defect in this repo is a complete write path against a partial read path, and
// a second seeding implementation would be exactly that.
//
// prev is the ordinal of the frame BEFORE the first written frame, so its state
// excludes the cut frame's own events; those still ride the cut frame and apply
// on top. Returns nil when there is nothing to seed.
